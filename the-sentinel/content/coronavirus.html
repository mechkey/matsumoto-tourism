						<p>Pictured outside the White House's Oval Office today, Trump seemed to be in great form. He was breathing easily, with no difficulty whatsoever. In fact, it can be even be said that his breathing is BETTER than ever. A White House source, speaking on condition of anonymity said that "He [Trump] breathes better than any president since the founding of the French Republic. We simply have the best breathers, through the nose and mouth, in this country." In his usual good form, Trump commemorated the fastest recovery from Coronavirus in the world earlier today by tweeting that he was "feeling great!" <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FEELING GREAT!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313489465139134464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> Our reporters at the White House confirm that in fact, nobody has ever felt this great before. Trump's doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity and simultaneously breaking his hypocritical Hippocratic oath, let The Sentinel know that he had hoped that the president would specifically request he be injected with disinfectant, nor request to be irradiating powerful light in the ultraviolet spectrum into the body. Trump has previously suggested that these may be effective methods of treating Coronavirus and asked if anyone really has been far even as decided to use those methods to be studied by the medical research community.  </p>
